## Problem Definition:
Predict mental health risk (anxiety/depression severity) based on social media behavior and lifestyle patterns and understand how risk factors differ between males and females.

### Why AI (Not Rules)?    Because:
- Mental health risk is influenced by multiple interacting factors.
- Simple thresholds (like “screen time > 6 hrs.”) miss complex relationships
- ML can learn nonlinear patterns between sleep, usage time, content type, and psychometric scores.

## Data Understanding & Feature Engineering:
Data Understanding:
The dataset represents 8,000 social media users with detailed digital behavior and mental health indicators.
Each record combines:
- Demographics (Age, Gender)
- Usage behavior (screen time, activity type, late-night usage)
- Psychometric scores (GAD-7 for anxiety, PHQ-9 for depression)
The data is synthetic but scientifically grounded, generated using psychological research patterns.
Designed specifically for gender-based comparative analysis and behavioral risk modeling.

### Key observations from raw data:
- Mental health impact is behavior-driven, not caused by a single variable.
- Late-night usage and reduced sleep appear frequently with higher depression scores.
- Passive content consumption and social comparison are common anxiety triggers.

## Feature Engineering (Silver Layer) : 
Cleaned raw data by: Removing duplicates and handling missing values in critical numerical fields.
Created behavioral risk features to translate raw usage into meaningful signals:
Engineered Features:
- High_Screen_Time: Flagged users spending more than 6 hours daily on screens.
- Sleep_Deprived: Identified users sleeping less than 6 hours.
- LateNight_Sleep_Risk: Combined late-night activity with sleep deprivation.
- Passive_Usage_Risk: Captured risk from passive scrolling behavior.
- Social_Comparison_Risk: Represented exposure to comparison-driven content.
- High_Mental_Health_Risk (Target): Flagged users with moderate-to-severe anxiety or depression scores.
These features converted raw digital behavior into interpretable mental health risk signals.

## AI Innovation & Insight Generation:
What makes this project “AI” and not just SQL?
- Instead of only reporting mental health statistics, I designed behavioral risk signals from raw social media usage data.
- I transformed daily habits (screen time, sleep, late-night usage, activity type) into risk indicators.
These features helped uncover hidden behavioral patterns, not obvious from raw data alone.

### Key AI-driven insights generated:
- High screen time + sleep deprivation strongly correlates with higher anxiety and depression scores.
- Late-night social media usage amplifies mental health risk.
- Passive consumption and social comparison increase anxiety levels.
- Gender-based risk distribution highlights different behavioral impacts.

Innovation here is feature engineering + insight generation from behavior, not just prediction.

## Training, Evaluation & Metrics:
How I validated the model?
Model training and experiments were tracked using Mlflow and I logged key evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy –Mental health predictions require balanced evaluation.
- AUC –AUC helps avoid misleading accuracy in imbalanced datasets.
- Confusion Matrix – false positives vs false negatives- supports explainability and trust.

### Outcome:
- Model achieved stable performance.
- Predictions stored in a Gold prediction table.
- Metrics and model version fully reproducible via Mlflow.

## Database ↔ AI Workflow (Lakehouse Integration):
Data flows through:
- Bronze → Raw ingestion (Delta).
- Silver → Cleaned & feature-engineered data.
- Gold → Analytics tables & ML-ready datasets.
AI integration: ML model reads directly from Gold Delta tables.
Predictions written back to Gold prediction table.
Same data serves: SQL Analytics | Dashboards | ML training | Model inference.

This avoids data duplication and ensures single source of truth.

## Business Impact & Practical Use:
Why this project matters in the real world?
- Enables early detection of mental health risk based on behavior and helps platforms:
- Identify high-risk users proactively.
- Design targeted well-being interventions.
- Monitor impact of platform usage patterns.

### Practical applications:
- Mental health monitoring dashboards.
- Risk-based user segmentation.
- Responsible AI use in social platforms.

Scalable & production-ready:
- Automated jobs.
- Governed data access via Unity Catalog.
- ML lifecycle managed with Mlflow.
